      "('White', 20.0, 'Viognier', 'Oregon', 'US', 'Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.')\n",
      "('White', 15.0, 'Chardonnay', 'Oregon', 'US', \"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.\")\n",

      "('White', 22.0, 'Chardonnay', 'Oregon', 'US', 'Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice.')\n",
      "('White', 22.0, 'Riesling', 'Oregon', 'US', 'This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.')\n",
      "('White', 18.0, 'Pinot Gris', 'Oregon', 'US', 'This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.')\n",
      "('White', 19.0, 'Pinot Gris', 'Oregon', 'US', 'It seems that there has been a dramatic increase in the production of this wine. Gassy and thin, it shows a veneer of slightly sweet apple and finishes with a dusting of powdered sugar.')\n",
      "('White', 25.0, 'Viognier', 'Oregon', 'US', \"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.\")\n",
